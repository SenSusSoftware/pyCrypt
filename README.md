# pyCrypt
Simple python script which crypts strings using know hashing algorithms.

This is simple python script which crypts strings using known hashing algorithms [SHA512,SHA384,SHA256,SHA224,SHA1,MD5].


When you start this program you can see the ASCII banner and some basic info about program.
Your first option is to crypt only one string, or you can specify the location of the .txt file which contains a lot of strings.Then you can choose which algorithm you would like to use and at the end of all you are asked if you want to leave program or to crypt more strings.

If you are going to use this program to hash your passwords i can say that this piece of code is perfect for you.This program will not upload passwords to web or hash databases.

I am working right now on some new options for this project.
If you have any suggestions please let me know in the comment section on GitHub.
